Please see the author comment as "Chen Xingke, Wang Yan, and Ren Honglei have all made significant contributions to this work. Specifically, Chen Xingke and Peng Lei jointly performed all experimental procedures and data analysis; Wang Yan supervised the experiments and assisted in clinical diagnosis; Ren Honglei provided experimental materials and partial funding support. As first-time submitters, we were unfamiliar with the submission system and inadvertently omitted these authors in the platform. However, all submitted manuscript versions consistently listed these co-authors, and no authors were added post-acceptance. We kindly request that these contributors be retained as co-authors. Thank you." Kindly check and advise how to proceed further.
